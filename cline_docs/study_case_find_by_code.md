# Study Case: "Find by Code" Functionality

This document details the process of debugging and improving the "Find by Code" feature in the EduWorksheets application.

## 1. Problem Identification

The initial problem was reported by a user who was unable to find a class using its code, even though the class data was confirmed to exist in the database. The system returned a "Code not found" error, indicating a failure in the search and data retrieval process.

## 2. Initial Investigation

The investigation began by analyzing the key components involved in the "Find by Code" feature:

1.  **Database Function**: The `find_by_code` SQL function was examined. It was designed to search for a code in both the `classes` and `users` tables and return the corresponding data. The function's logic was confirmed to be correct.

2.  **Frontend Component**: The `SearchPage.tsx` React component was reviewed. This component was responsible for capturing user input, triggering the search, and displaying the results. The implementation of the search trigger and data handling appeared to be correct.

3.  **Service Layer**: The `supabaseService.ts` file, which contains the `findByCode` function, was analyzed. This function handles the RPC call to the database. It was found to be using `.single()` to execute the call, which expects exactly one row in return.

## 3. Root Cause Analysis

The root cause of the issue was identified as Supabase's **Row Level Security (RLS)**. The `find_by_code` function was running with the permissions of the user who called it (`SECURITY INVOKER`). Because the user was not yet a member of the class they were searching for, the RLS policy on the `classes` table prevented the function from accessing the class record.

As a result, the function returned zero rows, which the service layer correctly interpreted as "Code not found."

## 4. Solution Implementation

To resolve this issue, the `find_by_code` function was modified to bypass the user's RLS policies. This was achieved by changing the function to run with the permissions of its owner, who has administrative privileges.

The following steps were taken:

1.  **Modify the SQL Migration File**: The `supabase/migrations/20250715000000_create_find_by_code_function.sql` file was updated to add `SECURITY DEFINER` to the function definition.

2.  **Apply the Database Migration**: The database migration was run to apply the change, which allowed the search to function correctly for all users.

## 5. UI/UX Improvement

After resolving the functional bug, the user provided feedback that the search page's UI was unattractive. To address this, the `SearchPage.tsx` component was redesigned with a more modern and user-friendly layout.

The following improvements were made:

*   **Card-Based Layout**: The search results are now displayed in a clean, organized card-based layout.
*   **Centered Design**: The page now has a more centered and visually appealing design.
*   **Enhanced User Experience**: The overall user experience was improved with a more intuitive and attractive interface.

## 6. Final Outcome

The "Find by Code" feature is now fully functional and visually appealing. The backend bug was resolved by addressing the RLS issue, and the frontend was enhanced based on user feedback. The final result is a more robust and user-friendly search experience.
