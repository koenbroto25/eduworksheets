# Case Study: Resolving Frontend Crash After Backend RPC Refactor

**Date:** July 19, 2025

## 1. Problem Summary

A critical runtime error occurred on the "Class Detail" page. When a teacher clicked the "Settings" icon on an assigned exercise, the application crashed. The browser console displayed the error: `Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'title')` originating from the `ClassExerciseSettingsModal.tsx` component.

This bug appeared after a significant backend refactor that transitioned data fetching from direct table queries to a more secure, RPC-based system to handle complex Row Level Security (RLS) policies.

## 2. Analysis and Investigation

My investigation followed a systematic, multi-step process to pinpoint the root cause.

### Step 1: Reviewing Backend Context
I started by consulting `cline_docs/backendContext.md`. The documentation revealed that a new RPC function, `getClassExercises`, was implemented. This function returns a "flattened" data structure, combining fields from both the `class_exercises` and `exercises` tables into a single object. This was a departure from the previous approach, where the frontend received a nested object structure that matched the `ClassExercise` type definition in `src/types/index.ts`.

### Step 2: Analyzing the Crashing Component
I examined `src/components/classroom/ClassExerciseSettingsModal.tsx`. The code confirmed that the component was trying to access the exercise title via a nested property: `exerciseData.exercise.title`. This directly conflicted with the flattened data structure returned by the new RPC function, confirming that `exerciseData.exercise` was `undefined`.

### Step 3: Tracing the Data Flow
I then analyzed the parent component, `src/pages/ClassDetailPage.tsx`. This component was responsible for fetching the data using `supabaseService.getClassExercises` and passing the selected exercise to the modal. The code showed that the state `selectedExercise` was being populated with the flattened object from the API and then passed directly as the `exerciseData` prop to the modal, leading to the crash.

### Step 4: Examining Type Definitions
Finally, I reviewed `src/types/index.ts`. The `ClassExercise` type clearly defined a nested structure: `exercise: Exercise`. This confirmed the mismatch between the frontend's type expectations and the actual data shape returned by the backend.

## 3. Root Cause

The root cause was a data structure mismatch between the backend and the frontend. The new `getClassExercises` RPC function returned a flattened object for performance and security reasons, but the frontend components (`ClassExerciseSettingsModal`, `ExerciseCard`, and `ClassDetailPage`) were still expecting the old, nested data structure. This led to the `TypeError` when the modal tried to access a non-existent nested property.

## 4. Resolution Plan

To resolve this issue and improve code quality, I formulated a comprehensive plan:

1.  **Create a New Type:** Define a new type, `FlatClassExercise`, in `src/types/index.ts` to accurately represent the flattened data structure returned by the `getClassExercises` RPC function. This new type will combine properties from both `Exercise` and `ClassExercise`.
2.  **Update `ClassExerciseSettingsModal.tsx`:** Refactor the modal to accept the new `FlatClassExercise` type and access the exercise title directly (e.g., `exerciseData.title` instead of `exerciseData.exercise.title`).
3.  **Update `ClassDetailPage.tsx`:** Modify the page to use the `FlatClassExercise` type for its state and props, removing the `as any` type assertion and enhancing type safety.
4.  **Update `ExerciseCard.tsx`:** Refactor the `ExerciseCard` component to handle the `FlatClassExercise` type, ensuring consistent data handling across all related components.

This plan not only fixes the immediate crash but also aligns the frontend's type definitions with the backend's API contract, preventing future bugs and improving the overall maintainability of the codebase.

## 5. Status

**RESOLVED** - The implementation has been completed, and the bug is fixed.
