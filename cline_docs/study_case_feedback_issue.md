# Study Case: Feedback Display Issue

**Status: Selesai (Finished)**

This document details the investigation and resolution of a critical bug where the post-exercise feedback and explanation screen failed to render for users.

## 1. The Problem

When a user completed an exercise on the `/take-exercise/{id}` or `/public-take-exercise/{id}` pages, they were correctly shown their score, but the detailed, question-by-question feedback view did not appear. This was inconsistent with the behavior of the "Exercise Preview" mode, which correctly displayed full explanations.

## 2. Investigation and Root Cause Analysis

The debugging process involved several incorrect assumptions, including potential issues with the rendering logic and component structure. However, after careful analysis and user feedback, the root cause was identified:

**Flawed and Inconsistent Data Fetching.**

The core issue was that the pages responsible for displaying the exercises (`TakeExercisePage.tsx` and `PublicTakeExercisePage.tsx`) were not fetching the complete data for the exercise and its associated questions. The initial Supabase queries were either too simple or relied on nested selections that failed to retrieve all necessary fields, specifically the `explanation` field from the `questions` table.

A critical oversight was also identified: there are two separate pages for taking exercises (one for authenticated users and one for public users), and the fix was initially only being applied to the wrong one.

## 3. The Solution

A robust, two-part solution was implemented to resolve the issue permanently:

### Part 1: Centralized, Robust Data Fetching

A new function, `getExerciseWithQuestions(exerciseId)`, was created in `src/services/supabaseService.ts`. This function implements a reliable two-step fetching strategy:

1.  It first fetches the main exercise data from the `exercises` table.
2.  It then performs a second, separate query to fetch all associated records from the `questions` table.
3.  Finally, it combines these two data sources into a single, complete exercise object, ensuring all necessary data is present.

### Part 2: Correctly Applying the Fix

The `TakeExercisePage.tsx` and, crucially, the `PublicTakeExercisePage.tsx` were both refactored to use this new, centralized `getExerciseWithQuestions` service function. This ensures that both authenticated and public users receive the complete data needed to render the feedback form.

Additionally, the `PublicTakeExercisePage.tsx` was updated to use the `ExerciseResults` component, ensuring a consistent and correct display of the final score and detailed feedback, mirroring the functionality of the authenticated version and the exercise preview.

This comprehensive solution corrected the data flow at its source, resolving the bug and ensuring a consistent, high-quality user experience across the platform.
