# Database Setup Instructions - URGENT FIX REQUIRED

## ðŸš¨ CRITICAL: Your signup is failing because the database isn't set up yet!

The "Database error saving new user" error occurs because your Supabase database doesn't have the required tables and functions yet.

#### Step 1: Open Supabase SQL Editor
1. Go to [Supabase Dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard)
2. Select your project
3. Click **SQL Editor** in the left sidebar

#### Step 2: Run the Complete Setup Script
1. Copy the **entire contents** of `supabase/migrations/setup_complete_user_system.sql`
2. Paste it into the SQL Editor
3. Click **Run** to execute the script

#### Step 3: Verify Setup
After running the script, check that these tables exist in your **Table Editor**:
- âœ… `users`
- âœ… `exercises` 
- âœ… `questions`
- âœ… `classes`
- âœ… `class_students`
- âœ… `class_exercises`

## What This Fixes:

The migration script creates:

### ðŸ”§ **Database Structure**
- All required tables with proper relationships
- Enum types for roles, difficulty levels, and question types
- Foreign key constraints for data integrity

### ðŸ”’ **Security System**
- Row Level Security (RLS) enabled on all tables
- Comprehensive access policies
- User role-based permissions

### âš¡ **Automation**
- `handle_new_user()` function that creates user profiles automatically
- Triggers for progress tracking and timestamp management
- Class code generation for classroom features

### ðŸš€ **Performance**
- Strategic database indexes
- Optimized queries for fast loading

## Troubleshooting:

**If you still get errors after running the script:**

1. **Check SQL Editor logs** - Look for any red error messages
2. **Verify auth.users exists** - This should be automatic in Supabase
3. **Confirm RLS is enabled** - Check the shield icons in Table Editor
4. **Try a fresh browser tab** - Clear any cached errors

**Common Issues:**
- **"Function already exists"** - This is normal, the script handles duplicates
- **"Permission denied"** - Make sure you're the project owner
- **"Table already exists"** - The script uses `IF NOT EXISTS` so this is safe

---

## After Setup Success:

Once your database is working, you can:
- âœ… Create teacher and student accounts
- âœ… Build and share educational exercises  
- âœ… Set up virtual classrooms
- âœ… Track student progress
- âœ… Use all app features

The complete EduWorksheets functionality will be available immediately after running this single migration script.
